We recommend using an interactive python environment such as jupyter-vscode (what we used)
in order to be able to execute sections of code separately. It is also necessary to have
all of the .py source files in the same folder.

To reproduce results:
Data import: Execute the data import section of preprocessing.py
Linear separability plots, PCA and VIF elimination: Execute the section of code (and imports)
    in preprocessing.py for that model
Model validation: Execute the section of code (and imports) in validation.py for that model
Sample ROCAUC plot and rank-gauss example: Execute the sections of code in misc.py
